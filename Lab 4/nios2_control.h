   This file defines macros that utilize the built-in functions
   in Altera's adaption of the GCC compiler to generate the
   control-register-access instructions for the Nios II processor.

   For ELEC 371 laboratory work, it has been modified by N. Manjikian.

   It should be noted that the manner in which the built-in functions
   are used below _differs_ from the manner in which they are shown in
   the DE0 Basic Computer reference document from Altera. The key
   difference is for _read_ operations. The conventional method of
   defining macros that read a value is to have the value returned,
   like a function. The method used in the original Altera code is
   not conventional. The second main difference is a simplification
   that avoids the use of a do..while loop found in the Altera version.
   The do..while loops may have been introduced for a specific reason (e.g.,
   to perhaps prevent the compiler from optimizing away the calls to
   the built-in functions, or to allow the assignment of the return
   value to a named variable). For the purposes of laboratory work,
   the revision of the macros by the instructor is appropriate, and
   the compiler-generated code is correct.

   The official names for the processor control register are ctl0, ctl1, ...
   These registers are more conveniently identified by their aliases,
   such as status, estatus, ...  Documentation on the Nios II processor
   provides the association between the official names and the aliases.

   Not all of the possible control-register accesses are covered by
   the macros below. The ones most relevant for ELEC 371 laboratory work
   are included. If access to the other control registers is required,
   additional macros could easily be introduced, based on the existing ones.

   The number on the right side of each macro definition refers to the
   corresponding 'ctl_' processor control register. The __builtin_wrctl()
   function passes the ctl register number and a value to the compiler for
   use in generating the appropriate assembly-language instruction.
   The __builtin_rdctl() function passes only the register number, and
   it _returns_ a value. The instructor-revised read macros then return
   this result as the return value of the macro for use by the C program.
